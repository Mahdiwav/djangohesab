# djangohesab
Hello, at the beginning of this project, I planned to write a calculator with Django to practice my skills, but I said to myself, why not write a complete calculator?!
So, I started writing this project and decided to develop it so that it can solve more math problems, so I want you to accompany me in this work.
# Install
First, you need to bring the project to your system with the following command

    git clone https://github.com/Mahdiwav/djangohesab.git

Then you need to install the Django framework with the following command

    python -m pip install Django

Great, now you have this calculator in your system
# How to Use 
First run the project then go to the index page and there you will see the first calculator
